# Online_game
Interactive online football game application like Fanta Champions League for a community of players 

## HOW DOES IT WORK
The platform allows users to register for the site and register for different competitions depending on the period. 
User information resides in a relational database "game" in the "users" table. 
When users log into the FANTA CHAMPIONS section, they can enter their inputs dragging and dropping the teams and see the ranking of users playing that competition. 
The score calculation is achieved by a php algorithm iterating over the users.
